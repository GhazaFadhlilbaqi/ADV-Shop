### Reflection 1
> You already implemented two new features using Spring Boot. Check again your source code and evaluate the coding standards that you have learned in this module. Write clean code principles and secure coding practices that have been applied to your code.  If you find any mistake in your source code, please explain how to improve your code.

I've applied several clean code principles to improve readability and maintainability. I use ```meaningful names``` for functions and variables, making their purpose clear. My functions follow the ```Do one thing rule```, keeping them focused and modular. Iâ€™ve also added ```input validation``` to ensure the correct data types to be inputted in the forms.

However, I need to ```add more comments``` for better documentation for each feature of my code. Another thing to take note of is to implement ```error handling```, to ensure the code runs smoothly even when issues arise. Addressing these will make my code more reliable and maintainable.
